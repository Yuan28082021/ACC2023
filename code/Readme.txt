Here are short usage of the code for paper H2 suboptimal containment control of multi-agent systems
>>containment_staic_3d.m uses our designed protocols
>>containment_staic_3d_paper.m uses the protocol from cited paper <“Containment of linear multi-agent systems under general interaction topologies”>
>>plot_containment_staic_3d.m is used for plot trajectory

1. Run containment_staic_3d (or containment_staic_3d_paper) in Matlab
2. Then open h2_containment_static_3d.slx and simulate it
3. Run plot_containment_staic_3d.m to generate the trajectory
