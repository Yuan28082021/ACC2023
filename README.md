## Abstract: 

This paper deals with the distributed H2 suboptimal containment control problem by static state feedback for
linear multi-agent systems. Given multiple autonomous leaders,
a number of followers, and an H2 cost functional, we aim to
design a distributed protocol that achieves containment control
while the associated H2 cost is smaller than an a priori given
upper bound. To that end, we first show that the H2 suboptimal
containment control problem can be equivalently recast into the
H2 suboptimal control problem of a set of independent systems.
Based on this, a design method is provided to compute such
a distributed protocol. The computation of the feedback gain
involves a single Riccati inequality whose dimension is equal to
the dimension of the states of the agents. The performance of
the proposed protocol is illustrated by a simulation example.
